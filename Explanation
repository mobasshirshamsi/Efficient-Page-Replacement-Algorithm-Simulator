What is a README.md?
A README.md file is like an instruction manual for your project. When you upload your code to GitHub, this file appears on the main page of your repository. It explains:
What your project does
 How to run it
 Which algorithms it implements
Sample outputs and expected results

üîπ What Should Your README.md Contain?
Here‚Äôs a basic structure for your Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator README file:

Project Title
Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

 Project Overview
This project simulates various page replacement algorithms used in Operating Systems for efficient memory management. It helps analyze the performance of different algorithms by computing metrics like page faults and hit ratio.

 Features
‚úîÔ∏è Supports multiple algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Optimal)
‚úîÔ∏è Calculates hit ratio & page fault ratio
‚úîÔ∏è Displays real-time page replacement steps
‚úîÔ∏è CLI-based (command-line interface)

 Installation & Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Page-Replacement-Simulator.git  

# Navigate into the directory
cd Page-Replacement-Simulator  

# Compile the Java files
javac PageReplacementSimulator.java  

# Run the program
java PageReplacementSimulator  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Algorithms Implemented
FIFO (First-In-First-Out)

LRU (Least Recently Used)

Optimal Page Replacement

6Ô∏è‚É£ Sample Output
yaml
Copy
Edit
Enter the number of frames: 3  
Enter the reference string: 7 0 1 2 0 3 4 2 3 0 3 2 1 2  

FIFO Page Replacement Result:
Page Faults: 9  
Hit Ratio: 35%  
7Ô∏è‚É£ Future Improvements (Optional Section)
Add LFU & Clock Algorithm

Convert CLI to GUI using Java Swing

Compare algorithms in graphical form
